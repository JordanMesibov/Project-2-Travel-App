# Project-2-Travel-App

Sometime, it can be hard for a group of people to decide on a location for a group vacation. We wanted to code a way for a group to reach a great decision that hopefully makes the most people as happy as possible. Here!, this is a solution calls a **Sounder project**


This is a **"Sonder project"**. This application helps groups of people decide on their vacation plans.

This application allows users to create a vacation group or event. After that, user will input vacation options (ie cities) for members to vote on and rank on a scale from 1-10. It simulates an instant runoff election using this data to give the group a winning city.
